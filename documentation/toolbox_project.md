# Toolbox Project

``Toolbox Project``is a personal productivity software for daily routine tasks, like task planning, time management, calendar scheduling, and saving favourite websites.
``Toolbox project`` idea struck me after I realized that in the course my browsing, I often come across useful resources on the internet, that are worth remembering. A common way to save these resources/websites is to bookmark them.
However, bookmarking is not always convenient, as you may find yourself using more than one browser. With bookmarking, you would be forced to create folders for your favourites websites.
This is too much work already, and your favourite resources would be scatterred, and probably repeated on every browser.

With ``Toolbox Project``, there will be a single bookmarking and 'storage' tool for your favourite websites. You will be able to have all your favourite resources in one place.
This tool is called Aggregator.

Other tools under Toolbox Project include:
- ``Task Planner``: A CRUD-powered tool that let's you plan out your daily activities. At the simplest, it is just a task planner. However, other features will be incorporated later, like sending a notification when a particular task is almost due, or automatically scheduling your tasks in your calendar.
- ``Timer:`` A tool that helps you manage your time by allowing you to set time for particular task and notify you when the time is about to elapse, and when the time elapses.
